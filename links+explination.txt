and the explanation for the design section is as follows:

for the design section we had to write a dataflow that connected to 
a Pub/Sub topic and filter the messages, then post them to another
topic. To do this, I cannibalized the code from example 4 since that
already read from a pubsub, then I wrote a simple class and function
that did the cleaning and conversions. I was able to basically reuse
the producer and consumer from milestone 2 and all I had to change
was the topics. after saving it and running it, my producer was 
sending messages and, after a little delay, the consumer would receive
those messages with the edits that the dataflow was doing.

All the code I wrote is in this repo with the "design pubsub.py" file
being the dataflow code that was running on GCP
